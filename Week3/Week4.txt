I searched meetup.com for data science meetups in my city intended to look for meetings that share work experience on data science.   However most meetings in the technology category are on business/fund soliciting or product promotion.  I finally signed up a meeting  on how to change field to start a coding/technology career hosted by a coding bootcamp company.    However, the meeting was cancelled half hour before the scheduled time.

I will continue to search meetup to see if there is any meeting that suite my needs.




==================================
To observe if someone (including me) is exhibiting imposter syndrome, if someone feel unsecure or intimidated when they find out they do not some something or in the contrary they act surprised arrogant when find out they know something that other don't.

Imposter syndrome is a communication blocker.   Wtih the awareness of me or someone exhibiting imposter syndrome then act accordingly can open up communication.
