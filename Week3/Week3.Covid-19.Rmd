## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r load library}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r load-covid-19}
url_in<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/"

file_names<-c("time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv",
              "time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv",
              "time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv",
              "time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv" )

urls<-str_c(url_in,file_names)

global_cases<-read_csv(urls[1])
global_deaths<-read_csv(urls[2])
US_cases<-read_csv(urls[3])
US_deaths<-read_csv(urls[4])

```

```{r pivot}
global_cases <- global_cases %>%
	pivot_longer(col = -c('Province/State',
                              'Country/Region',Lat,Long),
                     names_to ="date",
                     values_to="cases") %>%
        select(-c(Lat,Long))	




global_deaths <- global_deaths %>%
	pivot_longer(col = -c('Province/State',
                              'Country/Region',Lat,Long),
                     names_to ="date",
                     values_to="cases") %>%
        select(-c(Lat,Long))	



```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
