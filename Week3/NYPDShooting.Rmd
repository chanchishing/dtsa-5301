When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load library}
```


```{r load library}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

```{r read data from URL}
# Reference https://catalog.data.gov/dataset by following the documentation
# the URL of the CSV is https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/833y-fsy8.csv?$limit=30000
# by the time of wirting this code there is 27K+ rows, so $limit is set to 30000

url_nypd_shooting<-"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/833y-fsy8.csv?$limit=30000"

nypd_raw<-read_csv(url_nypd_shooting)      
      

```
```{r renive Geo-Map related column, as no intention to do analysis on that area}
nypd_raw<-nypd_raw %>%
   select(-c(x_coord_cd:geocoded_column))

```

```{r there are duplicated values of incident_key but no rows are exactely the same, why ?}

dup_incident_key<-nypd_raw %>%
  group_by(incident_key) %>%
  filter(n()>1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(incident_key)

dup_incident_key %>%
  count()

nypd_raw %>%
     filter(duplicated(nypd_raw)==TRUE) %>%
     count()

```

```{r sample example rows of duplicated incident_key, the 'duplicated' inclidnet_key is related to multiple perp for the same incident}

nypd_raw %>%
  filter(incident_key==nth(dup_incident_key,10)$incident_key)

nypd_raw %>%
  filter(incident_key==nth(dup_incident_key,101)$incident_key)


nypd_raw %>%
  filter(incident_key==nth(dup_incident_key,9356)$incident_key)
